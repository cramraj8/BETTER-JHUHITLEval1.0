On Monday," the party called on ""all components of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) to engage in dialogue with the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF", an alliance of Sudan's armed movements) before the signing of the agreement on August 17. The Transitional Military Council and the FFC agreed on the contents of the Constitutional Declaration in the early hours of August 3.The document complements the agreements stipulated in a Political Charter that was signed by both parties on July 17. According to the declaration," the coming interim government will work ""towards achieving peace and comprehensive justice and ending the war by addressing the roots of the Sudanese problem and addressing its effects", taking into account provisional preferential measures for war-affected areas, less developed regions," and the most vulnerable groups"". The SRF has rejected the Constitutional Declaration"," saying that the document ""disregards the pivotal principles of peace and puts obstacles to the implementation of any coming peace agreement"". Khaled Omar"," Secretary-General of the Sudanese Congress Party told reporters in Khartoum on Monday that ""The issue of peace is a serious issue and without which democracy will not be achieved"". He emphasised that the comments of the SRF on the constitutional document should be taken into account before the final signing of the agreement. Vice-President of the party", Mastour Ahmed," said that the first tasks of the transitional period will be focused on the issue of peace. He pledged ""to work for the inclusion of the comments resulting from discussion and dialogue on peace in the agreement and its implementation in full"". Rejected After the junta and the FFC concluded the final text of the Political Charter on July 5", the SRF said it could not accept the accord," calling it ""just a contract concluded with the security forces to hit the [armed] movements and oppress the regions in the margin through a so-called civilian legitimacy"". Malik Agar", head of the Blue Nile faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N Agar) and member of the SRF," called for an urgent meeting of the FFC ""to consolidate the unity of the Sudanese opposition"" and ""to link the democratic transition to a just peace"". Delegations of the FFC and the SRF met in the Ethiopian capital in the last week of July. They discussed a number of contentious issues concerning the peace-making process. On July 25", they reached an agreement. According to a joint statement, the two parties agreed that the first task of the new, transitional, government must be to achieve a comprehensive peace agreement. They also decided to establish a joint body led by the FFC for the duration of the transitional period. This body will formulate a united vision on the Political Charter and the Constitutional Declaration. In its rejection of the Constitutional Declaration, the SRF said that the vision of peace agreed upon by all the parties of the FFC in Addis Ababa, was welcomed and accepted in the negotiating room by the African mediator and representatives of the junta, but it was met with fierce opposition from most representatives of the FFC. However," the armed movements coalition said they will ""continue with the African mediation"," the Transitional Military Council and its allies in the political forces to amend the Constitutional Declaration and the political agreement as to include the issues of peace in the form that guarantees their achievement before the final signing on the Constitutional Declaration on August the 17th"".

DR-T5-r1,NO,1f4708d8b233c1fcaf8e43ce78c41502,FATIMA, Portugal (Reuters) - Pope Francis gave the Catholic Church two of its youngest saints on Saturday, canonizing shepherd siblings believed to have seen the Madonna 100 years ago in a Portuguese town that is now a major pilgrimage site. Hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom slept outdoors to hold their places, broke into applause as the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics proclaimed the siblings - Francisco and Jacinta Marto - the newest of the Church’s saints. The two died at the ages of 10 and 9 years old, within three years of the 1917 apparitions, making them the youngest saints of the Church who were not martyrs. The Virgin of Fatima is venerated by Catholics around the world, a following underscored by the many national flags fluttering in the huge crowd, estimated at more than half a million. Marie Chantal,57, a life-long devotee, traveled more than 9,000 km from the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean to attend the ceremony. “I am very emotional because this pope is truly merciful and close to the people and I think he will bring us many good things,” she said. In the homily of a huge outdoor Mass, Francis prayed that the Madonna would protect the most vulnerable members of society, “especially the sick and the disabled, prisoners and the unemployed, the poor and the abandoned”. Two huge tapestries made from century-old photographs of the children dressed in the traditional peasant garb of the times hung from the church that is now the focal point of the sanctuary visited by about seven million people each year.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile Pope Francis prays on the grave of two of the three little sheperd at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Portugal May 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tony Gentile The story of Fatima’s shepherd children has captivated Catholics since their first reported vision on May 13, 1917. The Church believes the Madonna gave three children - Francisco and Jacinta Marto and their older cousin Lucia Dos Santos - three messages, the so-called secrets of Fatima. Dos Santos became a nun and died in 2005 at the age of 97, and efforts are underway to make her a saint as well. The first two secrets were revealed soon and concerned a vision of hell, seen by believers as a prediction of the outbreak of World War Two, a warning that Russia would “spread her errors” in the world, and a need for general conversion to God and prayer. The “third secret” intrigued the world for more than three-quarters of a century, inspiring books and cults convinced that it predicted the end of the world. In 2000, the Vatican said it was a prediction of the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul on May 13, the same day of the first reported apparition in 1917. John Paul believed the Madonna had diverted one of the bullets that hit him from his vital organs. He donated it to the sanctuary, where it is now embedded in the crown of the statue of the Madonna. Gracinda Vieira,57, slept outside during the chill night in Fatima to hold her place near the front of the crowd. “It was not a great sacrifice ... it is very important for me and for the Church,” said Vieira, who had traveled from her home 250 km north of Fatima in central Portugal.

DR-T5-r1, ,ec5ca7ad2bb846b3fce495db82d5fd4e,Jeddah- Saeed Al Abyadh Yemen's legitimate government called on the United Nations to assume its responsibilities towards the Stockholm Agreement signed by Yemeni parties under UN auspices, announced Presidential Advisor Abdulmalik al-Mekhlafi. Mekhlafi said the agreement had become “inexecutable” because militias have been evading handing over to local authorities the three ports: Hodeidah, Ras Isa, and As-Salif, as stipulated in its provisions. Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat, the advisor emphasized that the coup militias had no real desire to implement the agreement, which has been evident from the beginning. He noted that many terms of the agreement were ambiguous, and the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths did not define the responsibilities of the legitimate government and the coupists. Griffiths did not identify the party obstructing the implementation of the agreement, according to Mekhlafi. He stressed that the militias are using the time wasted to smuggle more weapons through Hodeidah port, which has not been subject to real control yet. The UN and the legitimate government were supposed to assume the control of the port, he indicated. If the UN is serious about the upcoming consultations, it must either announce the failure of the agreement and hold the militia accountable, or press the militias to implement all provisions, Mekhlafi cautioned. Meanwhile," Yemenis staged mass demonstrations in seven districts of the Tehama region denouncing the Houthi violations of the “Stockholm Agreement."" They also called on the government to withdraw the agreement", in response to the failure of the international community and its refusal to identify the party obstructing the implementation of the terms. The demonstrators considered that the Agreement allowed militias to continue their violations and breaches by strengthening their military capabilities in the three ports. The Tehama National Council vowed to continue the demonstrations if the government doesn’t implement their demands on withdrawing from the agreement, proceeding with the military operation, and liberating the three ports, in particular, Hodeidah which is the militias’ main outlet. The Deputy Chairman of the Council, Abdel-Rahman Al-Mashrei, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the demonstrations that started in seven districts came in protest against Houthi violations of the Stockholm Agreement. He pointed out that a delegation of the demonstrators handed the UN Secretary-General's office in the temporary capital, Aden, a letter calling on the international community to take deterrent measures against the militias and identify the party obstructing the agreement. Another message was sent to President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi demanding that the legitimate government withdraw from the Agreement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r1,NO,e98b31343c85db294db1c17c551d233a,Des électeurs dans un bureau de vote *Appeals for calm as results collation continues The Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA)'s election observation mission led by former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan on Friday in Freetown declared last Wednesday's general elections in Sierra Leone as peaceful and orderly," adding that they were ""conducted substantially in line with sub-regional"," continental and international standards."" Jonathan who stated this in EISA's interim report presented to the media also observed that voter turnout was impressive while the conduct of polling personnel was professional. He also appealed to the people of Sierra Leone and all stakeholders to remain as the electoral body continues to transmit and collate results of the elections. The report however noted that there was ""room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field."" Sierra Leone's National Electoral Commission was yet to release official results as at Friday evening", as collation and tallying were still on going. However EISA in the interim report said it was well aware of this fact," adding that its findings ""only reflects the mission's observations up to the conclusion of the counting process at polling stations."" The report said: ""The EISA Election Observation Mission commends the people of Sierra Leone for turning out in large numbers to register their will on 7 March 2018. In the absence of an incumbent in the presidential race"," the presidential election seems to be one of the most keenly contested in the post-civil war period. "" The EISA EOM notes the efforts of the different institutions to guarantee the integrity of the elections. On election day"," voter turnout was impressive and the conduct of polling personnel was professional. There were technical glitches that necessitated the postponement of elections in 18 polling stations. Election day proceeded in a largely peaceful manner albeit with isolated incidents that were immediately addressed. "" The EISA EOM is of the view that the process up until the end of the first day of tallying has so far been conducted substantially in line with sub-regional"," continental and international standards although there is room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field. ""The EISA EOM urges the people of Sierra to remain calm while they wait to see the process through. We call on political leaders to show true leadership by respecting the rule of law throughout the results tally process."" Other observer groups which returned similar verdicts in their earlier presentations included Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)", African Union (AU), The Commonwealth, Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA), European Union (EU), and The Carter Center (TCC) Below is the text of preliminary statement as presented by former President Jonathan: EISA Election Observation Mission to the 2018 Elections in Sierra Leone Preliminary Statement This statement presents the preliminary findings, conclusions and recommendations on the pre-election period and Election Day operations of the observation mission deployed by the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA). It is issued while the transmission and tallying of results are still on-going, and therefore only reflects the mission's observations up to the conclusion of the counting process at polling stations. This statement therefore neither covers the transmission of results nor the finalisation of the results tally process, this explains why this statement is preliminary. A final report covering the entire process will be issued by EISA about three months after the close of this mission. The EISA Election Observation Mission (EOM) is comprised of 12 Short Term Observers (STOs) who were deployed in Bo, Freetown, Kenema, Makeni, and Port Loko. The observers are now returning from their areas of deployment. The EISA EOM's assessment methodology is guided by its commitments within the framework of the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation. It's assessment of the electoral process is based on the principles and obligations for democratic elections stipulated in the following international benchmarks: the African Union Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections; the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance; and the Principles for Election Management, Monitoring and Observation (PEMMO). Our findings The political context in the lead up to the election was shaped by a number of issues which, in some cases, raised concerns and in other cases created uncertainties about the elections. These issues include the uncertainties around the declaration of the date of the elections and the debate about the referendum to adopt constitutional amendments proposed by the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC); and the court case against the NGC candidate that is yet to be adjudicated. Within this context, the EISA EOM notes the commitment of Sierra Leoneans to participate in democracy building in their country. The EOM also commends the Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) for facilitating the process that led to the signing of the 'Freetown Declaration' by presidential candidates on 28 February 2018. The signing of the declaration showed the commitment of the candidates to the conduct of peaceful elections. Cognisant of the fact that there were isolated incidents of violence in the tense pre-election period, the absence of widespread violence provided an atmosphere for Sierra Leoneans to freely show their support to their chosen candidates. The legal framework broadly provides sufficient basis for the conduct of democratic elections. The EISA EOM notes the following areas where the legal framework could further be strengthened for more democratic elections: The electoral system for presidential elections, which entails a 55% threshold and does not adequately address the issue of ethnic politics; Absence of provisions for independent candidature in presidential elections; Absence of provisions for affirmative action to promote the participation and representation of vulnerable and underrepresented groups such as women, youth and People with Disabilities (PWDs). On election management, the EISA EOM notes that the National Electoral Commission (NEC) and the Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) are constitutional bodies with their independence provided in the constitution. The EOM is however of the view that NEC's accountability to the president could potentially compromise its independence. Faced with the responsibility of conducting the first elections after closure of the United Nations Integrated Peace building Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) in March 2014, and the financial challenges due budgetary constraints, the NEC with government funding and the support of international technical and financial partners made reasonable efforts to deliver on the election calendar. Based on its assessment of the process until the release of this statement, the EISA EOM is of the view that the commission carried out its responsibilities in a non-partisan and proactive manner. It endeavoured to promptly address the operational challenges it was faced with. Voter registration was jointly conducted by the NEC and the National Civil Registration Authority (NCRA) for the first time. We note the challenges experienced during the data transfer process and the steps taken to review the register to include the missing names. It is our hope that the civil registry will be finalised before the next elections. The EISA EOM notes the delays in the printing of voter's cards and the steps taken by NEC to ensure that registered voters who did not have the cards were not disenfranchised. While the legal framework recognises the right of Sierra Leoneans living abroad to participate in electoral processes, the NEC did not provide for registration and voting by citizens residing outside the country. While noting the operational and financial requirements for diaspora voting, the EISA EOM regrets that eligible voters living abroad remain disenfranchised. On the candidate nomination process, similar to the situation in 2012, the bill tabled before parliament proposing a reduction of the stipulated candidate nomination fees was not passed and the president subsidised the fees on behalf of candidates. EISA EOM considers the failure to pass the proposed regulations on nomination fees as a stumbling block to inclusive participation in the electoral process. The current high nomination fees, if maintained, could discourage qualified candidates from vulnerable groups such as women, youth and PWDs from exercising their right to participate in the elections as candidates. In addition, the continuous subsidy by the government, which is not anchored in the legal framework could be misconstrued as an incentive to entice voters or rival candidates On party and campaign finance, we note the provisions for mandatory disclosure of finances on annual basis. We note the challenges faced by the PPRC to effectively enforce these provisions. We also note that the law does not provide for ceilings on campaign expenditure which opens the electoral process up to undue influence of money. On the role of the media, we acknowledge the efforts of the Independent Media Commission (IMC) to train journalists on conflict-sensitive reporting, towards mitigating election-related conflict. The IMC also developed a Media Code of Ethics. However, the EOM noted with concern that, despite a caution on cessation of promotion of any political interest 24 hours before the elections, four newspapers contravened this directive. The EISA EOM notes the value added by the presidential debates to public information, it specifically commends the initiative to convene debates for female candidates and local council election candidates. The EOM however considers the criteria set for parties to participate in the debates to be quite stringent, thus, only six out of the 16 presidential candidates met the criteria. On women and youth participation, the EISA EOM notes that while women constitute 52% of the voter register, overall less than 20% women contested in the parliamentary elections. This shows no improvement in women's representation. The 2018 elections however saw nomination of younger candidates. Civil society actively participated in the process through advocacy for electoral reforms, voter education efforts, election observation as well promoting political participation of youth, women and PWDs through various interventions. We commend the CSOs for operating Women's Situation Room, Media Situation Rooms and Civil Society Situation Room as hubs for information sharing and real time monitoring. It is of the view that these initiatives greatly enhanced the transparency of the poll. On election day procedures, the EISA EOM notes that overall, the stipulated procedures for opening, voting, closing and counting were largely complied with and that staff demonstrated competence in execution of their duties. The decision of the NEC to cap the number of voters per station to 300 voters made the management of the process easier. Each voter took an average of 6 minutes to complete the process. The secrecy of the ballot was guaranteed in most of the stations visited and election materials were available throughout the day. As stipulated in the Elections Act, party agents who were present at the count consented to and signed the Reconciliation and Result Form (RRF) and a copy was posted outside the station by the presiding officers. The EISA EOM notes with commendation the presence of citizen observers at all the polling stations visited. The presence of citizen observers and party agents is an important indicator of the transparency of an election. The Mission notes with concern the presence of heavily armed security personnel at the SLPP presidential candidate's premises at Goderich in the late afternoon on election day. Thanks to the presence of high level international dignitaries, the situation was de-escalated. The EISA EOM urges the security forces to refrain from such acts of aggression which are a potential threat to the existing peace and security in the country. On the tally process: EISA observers visited five regional tally centres. In its assessment of the early aspects of the results tally process, the EISA EOM notes that the process was off to a slow start as officials waited for materials to be transported from the different areas. The layout of the tally centres and the procedures stipulated by NEC did not facilitate direct observation of the procedures or easy interface between officials and observers. Observers depended on the figures projected on the screens. Tally procedures at the centre in Port Loko was interrupted for some hours due to technical problems with the generator. At the time of writing this statement, tallying was ongoing. The mission will provide further detailed assessment of the tally in its final report. Our recommendations Based on its observations and findings, the EISA EOM offers the following recommendations: Considering the importance of the result tally process and the tensions that attend this process, we urge the NEC to manage the process in a transparent and professional manner. Specifically paying attention to information management to avoid suspicions and misinformation. In the short term, in the event of a runoff election: Provide lamps and extra batteries that will cover both the opening and counting procedures. Reconsider the ban on vehicle movement to ensure citizens are able to move freely to exercise their franchise. Take steps to ensure that incidents similar to what happened at the premises of the SLPP candidate that involved interference by security agencies is not repeated. In the long term: Legal reforms: Revisit the report of the CRC and begin the process of constitution review deliberations at the parliament early in the life of the incoming parliament. Consider adoption of a lower threshold for determining the winner of presidential election. To also address the issue of ethnic politics, further criteria to ensure national spread of votes regionally for the winner of presidential election should be considered. Review the legal framework to strengthen the regulation of party and campaign finance and also strengthen the powers of the PPRC to effectively regulate party finance. In line with article 9(1b) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which Sierra Leone has ratified, the legal framework should be revised to provide affirmative action to promote the representation of women in elective positions. The legal framework should also be revised to provide affirmative action to promote the representation of PWDs in elective positions Election procedures The NEC should consider simplifying the ballot reconciliation and counting procedures to make it less tedious and easier for polling personnel, observers and monitors. The NCRA should finalise the civil registration process that started in 2017 and put appropriate steps in place to effectively register births and deaths. This will further strengthen the credibility of the voter register for future elections. Reconsider the ban on vehicles movement as this creates unnecessary tension and suspicion. CSOs and the media should consider a more inclusive criteria for participation in the presidential debates. All parties should be given equal opportunity to sell their agenda to the electorate. The EISA EOM commends the people of Sierra Leone for turning out in large numbers to register their will on 7 March 2018. In the absence of an incumbent in the presidential race, the presidential election seems to be one of the most keenly contested in the post-civil war period. The EISA EOM notes the efforts of the different institutions to guarantee the integrity of the elections. On election day, voter turnout was impressive and the conduct of polling personnel was professional. There were technical glitches that necessitated the postponement of elections in 18 polling stations. Election day proceeded in a largely peaceful manner albeit with isolated incidents that were immediately addressed. The EISA EOM is of the view that the process up until the end of the first day of tallying has so far been conducted substantially in line with sub-regional, continental and international standards although there is room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field. The EISA EOM urges the people of Sierra to remain calm while they wait to see the process through. We call on political leaders to show true leadership by respecting the rule of law throughout the results tally process.

DR-T5-r1,YES,215b24bd01c485e32d92e92b7a3d8f3e,(The Sept. 22 story was refiled to correct the age of Cardinal Zen to 86 from 76 in paragraph 10) By Philip Pullella VILNIUS (Reuters) - The Vatican on Saturday signed a landmark agreement giving it a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, though critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government. The provisional agreement, signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was announced as Pope Francis visited Lithuania on a four-day trip to the Baltic countries. It gives the Holy See a decisive role in the appointment of all bishops in a country whose around 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. The Vatican said the accord, a breakthrough after years of negotiations, was “not political but pastoral”. A Holy See statement did not mention Taiwan, which the Vatican recognizes diplomatically and which China sees as a renegade province. However, diplomats have said the accord was a possible precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations with Beijing after 70 years. Beijing does not allow countries to have diplomatic relations with both China and Taiwan.

The Vatican said the pope hoped “a new process may begin that will allow the wounds of the past to be overcome, leading to the full communion of all Chinese Catholics”. But prospects of such an agreement had divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism. “They’re giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It’s an incredible betrayal,” said Cardinal Joseph Zen, the feisty, 86-year-old former archbishop of Hong Kong who has led the opposition to the deal. “The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the Church in China but for the whole Church because it damages the credibility. Maybe that’s why they might keep the agreement secret,” Zen told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Vatican sources have said the deal will not be published and can be reviewed and fine-tuned in the future. READMITTED The Vatican said that as part of the deal, Pope Francis had recognized the legitimacy of the seven remaining state-appointed Chinese bishops who had been named without papal approval and had re-admitted them into the Church.

Vatican sources have said that a few bishops appointed by Rome will cede their places to bishops who had been appointed by Beijing. In future, new bishops first will be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities. The names of candidates will be sent to the Vatican and the pope will make a final decision, the sources said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r1,YES,fd3ad72b5322bc779e2f8ac20587d49a,Photo: Joe Gratz/Flickr By Samuel Ogundipe The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has written to President Muhammadu Buhari, urging him to back off on his administration's legal battles against the principal actors in the controversial Malabu Oil deal. The raging scandal over the OPL 245 oil block began in 2011 when the Goodluck Jonathan administration approved its purchase by Shell and Agip-Eni from Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd., a suspected briefcase firm with ties to Dan Etete, a convicted criminal who was Nigeria's petroleum minister from 1995 to 1998. The Jonathan administration officials who participated in the negotiation preceding the controversial sale of the massive oil block included Mohammed Bello Adoke, Attorney-General at the time; and Diezani Alison-Madueke, who was petroleum minister. Mr. Jonathan himself was named by investigators as being involved in the alleged fraud, but the former president strongly denies the charges. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has been pursuing fraud and criminal conspiracy charges against Mr. Adoke, Mr. Etete and their alleged accomplices since 2016. Messrs. Adoke and Etete are believed to be at large, and the anti-graft agency had repeatedly sought to fish them out. Messrs Adoke, Etete, Alison-Madueke and all other officials named in the scandal have denied wrongdoings. Mr. Adoke said the sale was approved to save Nigeria from huge financial losses that could arise from international arbitration lawsuits. In his letter to Mr. Buhari, Mr. Malami said, following due examination of the case files. he was able to determine that the EFCC has no significant evidence to prove its allegations of sharp practices against prominent players like Bello Adoke, Diezani Alison-Madueke and others. Besides, Mr. Malami said," the Nigerian government risks being portrayed before the international community and foreign investors as an unserious country that could not be trusted to live up to its obligations to international partners. ""Clearly", potential investors will not have the confidence to invest in Nigeria if the government of the country is perceived as one which does not honour its commitments," Mr. Adoke said of the OPL 245 oil deal which was approved by at least three former Nigerian Attorneys-General. The September 27, 2017 letter advised the president to pursue Nigeria's possible investment in the disputed oil blocks rather than trying to repossess it or prosecute former Nigerian government officials or Shell or Agip-Eni chiefs involved in the deal. PREMIUM TIMES recently obtained a copy of the letter, but excerpts of it were published by The Cable earlier this month. It came as the EFCC ramps up legal efforts towards bringing Mr. Adoke back into Nigeria to face prosecution. But Mr. Malami insisted that the anti-graft office is on a wild goose chase and that the president should immediately intervene to save Nigeria from international embarrassment and reputation damage. There is nothing to show that the parties as constituted were at all times working together and having 'meeting of the mind' to wit to forge CAC documents and use some for the purpose of divesting the shares of the complainants and thereafter enter into a settlement agreement with FGN and other parties to take delivery of the proceeds of sale OPL 245. ""There is also nothing in the proof of evidence to support the charge money laundering and it is therefore impossible for the prosecution to prove the elements which include illicit funds"," transfer for such through various channels to re-introduce same again into the regular financial system as legitimate funds in financial institutions etc. ""Without the express proof of these elements"," the count may not be sustained on the premise of the attached proof of evidence. ""The EFCC investigation and attached proof of evidence do not appear to have clearly revealed the case of fraud against the parties who claimed to have acted in their official capacities with the approval of three consecutive presidents of the federal government of Nigeria at the time with further claim that the matter was intended to be resolved in national interest thereby saving the nation acrimonious litigations resulting in high legal fees and the dormancy of the oil field while litigation lasted", Mr. Malami said. Mr. Malami said Nigeria should take advantage of some favourable clauses in the agreement that allowed for government's ownership of a part of the oil field. Your Excellency, the beneficial approach I counsel in the circumstances is for the federal government to take advantage of the terms of the agreement under clauses five and 11 to acquire a stake in the OPL 245 converting it to a production sharing contract (PSC) between FGN/NNPC, Shell and Agip after negotiating with the ENI/Shell to absorb the cost of the FGN/NNPC entry under the said clauses five and 11 through the PSC mechanism," Mr. Malami said. The Nigerian government, through the EFCC, has been trying to take possession of the lucrative oil deal, estimated to hold more than nine billion barrels of crude. However, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu, has been mounting pressure on the administration to allow Agip-Eni continue development of some parts of the field. Total investment from Agip involved in both the Zabazaba field", the power plant and the new refinery is in excess of $15 billion. That is major push in terms of our search for investment," Mr. Kachikwu said after emerging from another meeting with then-Acting President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House on May 9, 2017. Former Attorney-General of the Federation, Bello Adoke. The confusion in Nigeria over the scandal continues as Italian prosecutors are proceeding with criminal charges against Shell executives suspected to be involved in the OPL 245 deal. The prosecutors are also reportedly making progress in their criminal allegations against some Nigerian players named in the scandal. Read the letter in full below: RE: FORWARDING OF CASE FILE IN RESPECT OF CHARGE NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/268/17 AND FCT/HC/CR/124/2017 MALABU OIL & GAS LTD May I refer Your Excellency to the above subject matter, please. 2. This case file was received from the EFCC in a letter dated 21st December, 2016 for vetting and further directive. Having fully examined the entire case file I am inclined to request you to note the following and direct accordingly. 3. A curious observation of the entire Malabu story clearly indicates that there are the civil and criminal aspects to the case. 4. The civil aspect bothers on the skirmishes between the directors of the company which led to the claims that shares of the same directors were divested without their consent thereby taking over their interest. Having examined the cases it is important to note that the cases are pending before the courts and therefore sub-judice; the FGN should await the outcome of the cases- Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/201/2017 MALABU OIL & GAS LTD vs. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA AND & 6 ORS; and Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/206/2017 MALABU OIL & GAS LTD vs. MR KWEKU AMAFAGHA & 9 ORS. 5. In the criminal case, the aggrieved parties through their lawyers petitioned the EFCC against some directors of Malabu Oil and Gas alleging fraudulent divestment of their shares and subsequently depriving them of their benefits in the sale of OPL 245. EFCC investigated the case and filed nine-count charge dated 16th September, 2016. 6. Attached to the charge are a proof of evidence, case summary and list of witnesses in support of the counts which bother on fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Regarding the criminal charge. Your Excellency is invited to note that the charge as presently constituted may most likely not succeed against the parties for the following reasons: a. There is nothing to show that the parties as constituted were at all times working together and having a 'meeting of minds' to wit; to forge CAC documents and use same for the purpose of divesting the shares of the complainants and thereafter, enter into a settlement agreement with FGN and other parties to take delivery of the proceeds of sale of OPL 245. b. There is also nothing in the proof of evidence to support the charge money laundering and it is therefore impossible for the prosecution to prove the elements which include illicit funds, transfer for such through various channels to re-introduce same again into the regular financial system as legitimate funds in financial institutions etc. Without the express proof of these elements, the count may not be sustained on the premise of the attached proof of evidence. c. The EFCC investigation and attached proof of evidence do not appear to have clearly revealed the case of fraud against the parties who claimed to have acted in their official capacities with the approval of three consecutive presidents of the federal government of Nigeria at the time with further claim that the matter was intended to be resolved in national interest thereby saving the nation acrimonious litigations resulting in high legal fees and the dormancy of the oil field while litigation lasted. d. In this regard, the Public Officers Protection Act CAP P41 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 limits liability of Public Officers to a period of three months much naturally come to mind considering their claim that the acts which are complained of were authorised by the three presidents before this current administration. 7.Your Excellency", the beneficial approach I counsel in the circumstances is for the federal government to take advantage of the terms of the agreement under clauses five and 11 to acquire a stake in the OPL 245 converting it to a production sharing contract (PSC) between FGN/NNPC, Shell and Agip after negotiating with the ENI/Shell to absorb the cost of the FGN/NNPC entry under the said clauses five and 11 through the PSC mechanism," Mr. Malami said. 8. The idea of revisiting the settlement agreement which resulted in the sale of the oil field to SNUD, SNEPCO and NAE is not workable. It is important in this regard for His Excellency to note the following: a. The agreement was executed by the highest authority in Nigeria and remains sacrosanct unless it is eventually set aside by the decision of a competent court of law and denying the parties immediate benefit of reaping the fruit of their investments. The agreement has its mechanism for compensation in the event of any of the rights conferred to ENI or SHELL are challenged or violated. For the FGN to revisit the agreement, the consent of Shell and ENI will be required. It is very unlikely that the consent will easily be obtained but rather they would rely on the protection afforded in the contract, and any unilateral effort by FGN to vary the terms of the agreement would probably open up a new bout of litigation, deter further investment, give rise to a claim for damages and payment of huge legal fees. Your Excellency may wish to note some of the FGN's representations and assurances in the clauses 12, 13 and 17 of the agreement. 12. FGN confirms that the terms of this FGN resolution agreement have been agreed by all the appropriate agencies of the FGN including the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Inland Revenue Service.' ""13. FGN acknowledges that", in entering into this FGN resolution agreement," the other parties have relied on its expressed or implied representation before the signature of this FGN resolution agreement regarding the efficacy of the terms thereof."" ""17. FGN shall indemnify", save and hold harmless, and defend SNUD, SNEPCO and NAE from and against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands losses and liability of any nature or kind, including, but not limited to, oil litigation costs, attorneys' fees, settlement payments, damages, and all other related costs and expenses, based on, arising out of," related to or in connection with: (i) this FGN resolution agreement. (ii) the resolution agreement/ (iii) the issuance of the oil prospecting license in respect of Block 245 jointly in the name of SNEPCO and NAE and arising out of any asserted prior interest in Block 245."" 9. The above commitments are binding on the FGN. ENI/Shell legitimately expects that the FGN would respect the commitments. Failure by the FGN to respect them would cast Nigeria in a very bad light internationally and negatively impact the FGN's quest for foreign investments. Clearly", potential investors will not have the confidence to invest in Nigeria if the government of the country is perceived as one which does not honour its commitments (captured in an agreement signed by three of its ministers). 10. ENI/Shell claims to have invested in excess of US $2.5 billion in OPL 245 from 2011 to date and as such would seek the protection of international law, including applicable investment treaties which prohibit the unreasonable, unfair and inequitable treatment of their investments and could expose FGN to international arbitration involving multi-billion dollars claims. 11. As the FGN/NNPC relies on the provisions of the resolution agreement, charges preferred against ENI/Shell companies and employees would necessarily have to be withdrawn as continuing with the charges will be inconsistent with the spirit of the relevant clauses of the resolution agreement which will enable FGN to obtain immediate interest in OPL 245. Regardless, as submitted in paragraph five and six above, the charges as constituted and filed by the EFCC are unsustainable. 12. Accept the assurances of my warm regards and loyalty, always. Abubakar Malami, SAN Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation & Minister of Justice.

DR-T5-r1, ,5253a2339cf96d33c72a6f3eabcbd6c9,Cairo- Mohammed Jad The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed the monetary policies adopted by the central banks of US and Europe as top risks facing the Egyptian economy during the coming period, knowing that these policies would contribute to the re-balance of the dollar and Euro against the Egyptian pound. The United States and Europe started after the world financial crisis to apply exceptional monetary policies that aim at keeping the interest rates low and interfering fiercely in the bond market to rescue the economy from recession. As the signs of economic re-balance started to show, these two economic entities started to withdraw gradually from the monetary policies. Commenting on these policies, the IMF said that in case any unexpected transformations took place in the world financial condition, this would weaken the market's attraction towards Egyptian pound bonds. Egypt depends on Euro bonds as one of the major sources to fill the gap of foreign currency resources amidst a fragility shown by the tourism sector in light of the security crises and the failure of foreign investments to reach the targeted average determined by the government. Egypt sold international bonds worth USD1.5 million in June 2015, for the first time since the January revolution in 2011. Further, it signed a loan deal in November under the framework of foreign funding. IMF warned from risks of the rise in oil prices, which would weaken the balance of the current account, increase the subsidy of fuels and affect negatively the public debt. On the local level, the fund warned from the slump of economic reforms whether due to exhaustion from reform procedures, the resistance from business owners or the authorities concerns regarding social tensions. It also warned from unannounced interventions in the currency exchange market in order to control the currency value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r1, ,de2d58402099942a7f620c323836a778,Nigeria: IMF Proffers Options to Sustain Country's Economic Recovery By Gboyega Akinsanmi Fresh crisis may be looming in the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the national leadership is alleged to have perfected plans to amend the party's constitution at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting slated for this month, in order to validate the tenure extension of its principal officers at all levels. Consequently, some concerned leaders of the ruling party have vowed to reject the planned amendment, which according to them violates Article 13(3-4) of the APC Constitution and Section 223(1-2) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. APC, at its last NEC meeting on February 27, had announced a 12-month extension for its elected and appointed executives at all levels of the party. Citing Article 13 of the APC constitution, which empowers the NEC to carry out the functions of the convention, the party said NEC decided to extend the tenure of the current NWC members and other executive committees at various levels for another twelve months, starting from June 30, 2018. It said the extension was done to prevent the likelihood of discord that might arise from a convention of the party in the run up to the 2019 elections. But this was immediately challenged by the Zamfara State governor and other leaders of the party," who said the decision taken at the last NEC meeting was only a ""mere expression of interest"". He had cautioned that the tenure extension could only be achieved through an amendment of the party's constitution by the National Convention of the APC. However", one of the concerned leaders yesterday disclosed the plan to amend the party's constitution at the next NEC meeting in an interview he granted THISDAY in confidence, warning against the decision, which he said will promote the reign of illegality and impunity in the ranks of the APC. He also faulted the process by which the National Working Committee (NWC) under the chairmanship of Chief John Odigie-Oyegun had set up the Constitution Amendment Committee led by the National Legal Adviser of the APC, Mr. Muiz Banire on January 25,2017," noting that the process did not comply with Article 13(3-4) of the party's constitution. Article 13(4) of the APC Constitution empowers the NWC ""to establish ad-hoc and/or standing committees of the party and appoint members to such committees"". While Article 13(3) empowers the NEC ""to ratify the type"," nature and membership of the ad-hoc and/or standing committees to be set up by the National Working Committee""", a condition the source said the party leadership did not comply with. Contingent on these provisions, the APC leader faulted the process that set up the constitution amendment committee in January last year, noting that the NWC constituted the committee without NEC's ratification as provided in Article 13(3). The APC leader further disclosed that the constitution amendment committee was meant to have submitted its report to the NEC meeting slated for October 31, 2017 but the meeting was postponed. As a result, the same constitution amendment report was slated for presentation at the February 27 NEC meeting of the party, but it was not considered. Instead, the party went ahead to announce the tenure extension for all its executives. He also pointed out that it was after the presidency had realised the illegality of the tenure extension that the NEC had granted the national and state officials, that a plan was hatched to table the report at the next meeting slated for this month. The goal, he said," is to allow the NEC exercise the power of National Convention and amend the APC Constitution to validate the tenure extension. He noted that the rationale behind the constitution amendment is to correct the flawed decision of the NEC ""to extend the tenure of the APC national chairman and other national and state executives by 12 months"". After President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the APC leadership to start preparing for the convention and congresses at the last National Caucus meeting of the party", the APC source alleged that it was the Ondo State governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu who had misadvised the presidency, informing it that the NEC could exercise the power of the convention to extend the tenure of the principal officers. Already," he noted that the presidency ""has realised the illegality of the tenure extension"". ""That is why the national leadership is planning to convene another NEC meeting. The meeting may hold between 10 and 15 days from now. The national officials want to use the meeting to correct their errors", he added. He also disclosed that the agenda of the meeting is first to tell the world that the tenure of the APC national chairman and other executives was not extended as reported in the media. The plan is to tell the world that the NEC only issued a notice of extension and not an extension," he explained He also warned that the move by the national leadership of the party would be at variance with Section 223(1-2) of the 1999 Constitution, which according to him, states clearly the processes, procedures and requirements for the emergence of political party officials. Section 223(1) states that the constitution and rules of a political party shall provide for a periodical election on a democratic basis of the principal officers and members of the executive committee or other governing body of the political party... "" Section 223(2) further states: ""The election of the officers or members of the executive committee of a political party shall be deemed to be periodical only if it is made at regular intervals not exceeding four years."" Based on these provisions"," the APC leader argued that the NEC lacks the power to amend the APC Constitution. ""The power to amend the party's constitution can only be exercised by the National Convention. Even if the NEC can exercise the party's constitution"," it cannot amend it to deviate from the provisions of the 1999 Constitution. ""Section 223(1-2) of the 1999 Constitution is clear about the conduct of national conventions and congresses. The section states clearly how the officials of parties at all levels can emerge at the end of their tenure. ""It never made provisions for tenure extension. Also", it does not give any organ of the party - except at the National Convention - the power to amend the constitution," he said, He also recalled that it was this kind of impunity and lawlessness that destroyed the People Democratic Party (PDP). We are all witness to the fall of the PDP"," he said, warning that some APC leaders were already walking on the path of destruction. The implication is huge for the future of the APC. First", it is a dangerous precedent for a party that promised change. Second," any person produced from that process can be removed if challenged at the court. ""Besides", opposition parties can take advantage of this to challenge the APC in court after the general election. So, the mandate of any political official produced from this process will be under threat," he warned. Another party source who spoke on the issue also confirmed that there was a plan to amend the party's constitution at the next NEC meeting, but said should the national leadership of the party go ahead with the plan, the Lagos chapter of the APC was prepared to go to court to challenge the validity of the decision. According to him, The move to amend the constitution at the NEC meeting can lead to a series of litigations and crises. I am aware that the Lagos APC is ready to go to court should the NEC amend the constitution and not the National Convention of the party."" When he was reminded that Article 13 of the APC Constitution empowers the NEC to carry out the functions of the convention"," he said: ""Even if we have to consider Article 13 of the constitution"," it is still debatable if NEC can assume the power of the National Convention or whether it can legally carry out an amendment of the constitution.""

DR-T5-r1,NO,c8f7bef7073ccd429f1b4741942d0a44,Gaza, Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat & Mohammed Nabil Hilmi The PA government based in the West Bank stressed the necessity for the return of all old employees to their jobs for the first time in 10 years, after Hamas seized Gaza in a 2007, instructing ministers to arrange for the transition. “The related ministers have to arrange the return of their employees through a suitable mechanism that would activate the function of the government in the southern districts (Gaza Strip) as part of the actual enforcement of the reconciliation agreement reached in Cairo in October," it added. The government said that the legal and administrative committee will look into the status of the employees appointed by the Hamas authorities in Gaza after June 14, 2007 as part of the government efforts to make the reconciliation successful. It said its empowerment in Gaza means that “all ministers should be able to do their duties in the southern districts just as in the northern ones (the West Bank) without any obstructions.” It also stressed “the empowerment of the government in the Gaza Strip and the exercise of its powers in full as in the West Bank without the interference of any party according to the law, including the unified financial empowerment through the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the sole party responsible for simultaneous collection and disbursement of funds.” “Full control over the crossings and government responsibility to impose public order and the rule of law in conformity with the justice sector, providing security and safety for the people and safeguarding their rights, property and freedoms and the need to accomplish this in full as a necessary first step and the cornerstone for moving to resolve the rest of the issues,” the statement further added. The 2011 agreement signed between the Palestinian factions in Cairo provides for returning all civil employees who were hired before 14th June 2007 in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including those absent or dismissed due to the division, with their full rights guaranteed and canceling all dismissal orders. The agreement underlines that this step shall be made based on a mechanism developed by the Administrative and Legal Committee, which will be formed by consensus, with no amendments or new appointments made until the Committee's work is completed. In October, Hamas and Fatah signed a landmark reconciliation agreement in Cairo aimed at healing their decade-long rift after Hamas captured Gaza from Fatah in 2007 after days of street fighting. In return, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said the government call for former employees to return to their jobs was “in violation of a 2011 reconciliation deal in Cairo” between Palestinian factions. Barhoum said in a statement that the government's decision is contrary to a pre-existing agreement that the return of the employees hired before 14th June 2007 should be implemented in accordance with a mechanism set by the Administrative and Legal Committee.
DR-T5-r2, ,e98b31343c85db294db1c17c551d233a,Des électeurs dans un bureau de vote *Appeals for calm as results collation continues The Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA)'s election observation mission led by former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan on Friday in Freetown declared last Wednesday's general elections in Sierra Leone as peaceful and orderly, adding that they were conducted substantially in line with sub-regional"," continental and international standards."" Jonathan who stated this in EISA's interim report presented to the media also observed that voter turnout was impressive while the conduct of polling personnel was professional. He also appealed to the people of Sierra Leone and all stakeholders to remain as the electoral body continues to transmit and collate results of the elections. The report however noted that there was ""room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field."" Sierra Leone's National Electoral Commission was yet to release official results as at Friday evening", as collation and tallying were still on going. However EISA in the interim report said it was well aware of this fact," adding that its findings ""only reflects the mission's observations up to the conclusion of the counting process at polling stations."" The report said: ""The EISA Election Observation Mission commends the people of Sierra Leone for turning out in large numbers to register their will on 7 March 2018. In the absence of an incumbent in the presidential race"," the presidential election seems to be one of the most keenly contested in the post-civil war period. "" The EISA EOM notes the efforts of the different institutions to guarantee the integrity of the elections. On election day"," voter turnout was impressive and the conduct of polling personnel was professional. There were technical glitches that necessitated the postponement of elections in 18 polling stations. Election day proceeded in a largely peaceful manner albeit with isolated incidents that were immediately addressed. "" The EISA EOM is of the view that the process up until the end of the first day of tallying has so far been conducted substantially in line with sub-regional"," continental and international standards although there is room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field. ""The EISA EOM urges the people of Sierra to remain calm while they wait to see the process through. We call on political leaders to show true leadership by respecting the rule of law throughout the results tally process."" Other observer groups which returned similar verdicts in their earlier presentations included Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)", African Union (AU), The Commonwealth, Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA), European Union (EU), and The Carter Center (TCC) Below is the text of preliminary statement as presented by former President Jonathan: EISA Election Observation Mission to the 2018 Elections in Sierra Leone Preliminary Statement This statement presents the preliminary findings, conclusions and recommendations on the pre-election period and Election Day operations of the observation mission deployed by the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA). It is issued while the transmission and tallying of results are still on-going, and therefore only reflects the mission's observations up to the conclusion of the counting process at polling stations. This statement therefore neither covers the transmission of results nor the finalisation of the results tally process, this explains why this statement is preliminary. A final report covering the entire process will be issued by EISA about three months after the close of this mission. The EISA Election Observation Mission (EOM) is comprised of 12 Short Term Observers (STOs) who were deployed in Bo, Freetown, Kenema, Makeni, and Port Loko. The observers are now returning from their areas of deployment. The EISA EOM's assessment methodology is guided by its commitments within the framework of the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation. It's assessment of the electoral process is based on the principles and obligations for democratic elections stipulated in the following international benchmarks: the African Union Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections; the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance; and the Principles for Election Management, Monitoring and Observation (PEMMO). Our findings The political context in the lead up to the election was shaped by a number of issues which, in some cases, raised concerns and in other cases created uncertainties about the elections. These issues include the uncertainties around the declaration of the date of the elections and the debate about the referendum to adopt constitutional amendments proposed by the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC); and the court case against the NGC candidate that is yet to be adjudicated. Within this context, the EISA EOM notes the commitment of Sierra Leoneans to participate in democracy building in their country. The EOM also commends the Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) for facilitating the process that led to the signing of the 'Freetown Declaration' by presidential candidates on 28 February 2018. The signing of the declaration showed the commitment of the candidates to the conduct of peaceful elections. Cognisant of the fact that there were isolated incidents of violence in the tense pre-election period, the absence of widespread violence provided an atmosphere for Sierra Leoneans to freely show their support to their chosen candidates. The legal framework broadly provides sufficient basis for the conduct of democratic elections. The EISA EOM notes the following areas where the legal framework could further be strengthened for more democratic elections: The electoral system for presidential elections, which entails a 55% threshold and does not adequately address the issue of ethnic politics; Absence of provisions for independent candidature in presidential elections; Absence of provisions for affirmative action to promote the participation and representation of vulnerable and underrepresented groups such as women, youth and People with Disabilities (PWDs). On election management, the EISA EOM notes that the National Electoral Commission (NEC) and the Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) are constitutional bodies with their independence provided in the constitution. The EOM is however of the view that NEC's accountability to the president could potentially compromise its independence. Faced with the responsibility of conducting the first elections after closure of the United Nations Integrated Peace building Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) in March 2014, and the financial challenges due budgetary constraints, the NEC with government funding and the support of international technical and financial partners made reasonable efforts to deliver on the election calendar. Based on its assessment of the process until the release of this statement, the EISA EOM is of the view that the commission carried out its responsibilities in a non-partisan and proactive manner. It endeavoured to promptly address the operational challenges it was faced with. Voter registration was jointly conducted by the NEC and the National Civil Registration Authority (NCRA) for the first time. We note the challenges experienced during the data transfer process and the steps taken to review the register to include the missing names. It is our hope that the civil registry will be finalised before the next elections. The EISA EOM notes the delays in the printing of voter's cards and the steps taken by NEC to ensure that registered voters who did not have the cards were not disenfranchised. While the legal framework recognises the right of Sierra Leoneans living abroad to participate in electoral processes, the NEC did not provide for registration and voting by citizens residing outside the country. While noting the operational and financial requirements for diaspora voting, the EISA EOM regrets that eligible voters living abroad remain disenfranchised. On the candidate nomination process, similar to the situation in 2012, the bill tabled before parliament proposing a reduction of the stipulated candidate nomination fees was not passed and the president subsidised the fees on behalf of candidates. EISA EOM considers the failure to pass the proposed regulations on nomination fees as a stumbling block to inclusive participation in the electoral process. The current high nomination fees, if maintained, could discourage qualified candidates from vulnerable groups such as women, youth and PWDs from exercising their right to participate in the elections as candidates. In addition, the continuous subsidy by the government, which is not anchored in the legal framework could be misconstrued as an incentive to entice voters or rival candidates On party and campaign finance, we note the provisions for mandatory disclosure of finances on annual basis. We note the challenges faced by the PPRC to effectively enforce these provisions. We also note that the law does not provide for ceilings on campaign expenditure which opens the electoral process up to undue influence of money. On the role of the media, we acknowledge the efforts of the Independent Media Commission (IMC) to train journalists on conflict-sensitive reporting, towards mitigating election-related conflict. The IMC also developed a Media Code of Ethics. However, the EOM noted with concern that, despite a caution on cessation of promotion of any political interest 24 hours before the elections, four newspapers contravened this directive. The EISA EOM notes the value added by the presidential debates to public information, it specifically commends the initiative to convene debates for female candidates and local council election candidates. The EOM however considers the criteria set for parties to participate in the debates to be quite stringent, thus, only six out of the 16 presidential candidates met the criteria. On women and youth participation, the EISA EOM notes that while women constitute 52% of the voter register, overall less than 20% women contested in the parliamentary elections. This shows no improvement in women's representation. The 2018 elections however saw nomination of younger candidates. Civil society actively participated in the process through advocacy for electoral reforms, voter education efforts, election observation as well promoting political participation of youth, women and PWDs through various interventions. We commend the CSOs for operating Women's Situation Room, Media Situation Rooms and Civil Society Situation Room as hubs for information sharing and real time monitoring. It is of the view that these initiatives greatly enhanced the transparency of the poll. On election day procedures, the EISA EOM notes that overall, the stipulated procedures for opening, voting, closing and counting were largely complied with and that staff demonstrated competence in execution of their duties. The decision of the NEC to cap the number of voters per station to 300 voters made the management of the process easier. Each voter took an average of 6 minutes to complete the process. The secrecy of the ballot was guaranteed in most of the stations visited and election materials were available throughout the day. As stipulated in the Elections Act, party agents who were present at the count consented to and signed the Reconciliation and Result Form (RRF) and a copy was posted outside the station by the presiding officers. The EISA EOM notes with commendation the presence of citizen observers at all the polling stations visited. The presence of citizen observers and party agents is an important indicator of the transparency of an election. The Mission notes with concern the presence of heavily armed security personnel at the SLPP presidential candidate's premises at Goderich in the late afternoon on election day. Thanks to the presence of high level international dignitaries, the situation was de-escalated. The EISA EOM urges the security forces to refrain from such acts of aggression which are a potential threat to the existing peace and security in the country. On the tally process: EISA observers visited five regional tally centres. In its assessment of the early aspects of the results tally process, the EISA EOM notes that the process was off to a slow start as officials waited for materials to be transported from the different areas. The layout of the tally centres and the procedures stipulated by NEC did not facilitate direct observation of the procedures or easy interface between officials and observers. Observers depended on the figures projected on the screens. Tally procedures at the centre in Port Loko was interrupted for some hours due to technical problems with the generator. At the time of writing this statement, tallying was ongoing. The mission will provide further detailed assessment of the tally in its final report. Our recommendations Based on its observations and findings, the EISA EOM offers the following recommendations: Considering the importance of the result tally process and the tensions that attend this process, we urge the NEC to manage the process in a transparent and professional manner. Specifically paying attention to information management to avoid suspicions and misinformation. In the short term, in the event of a runoff election: Provide lamps and extra batteries that will cover both the opening and counting procedures. Reconsider the ban on vehicle movement to ensure citizens are able to move freely to exercise their franchise. Take steps to ensure that incidents similar to what happened at the premises of the SLPP candidate that involved interference by security agencies is not repeated. In the long term: Legal reforms: Revisit the report of the CRC and begin the process of constitution review deliberations at the parliament early in the life of the incoming parliament. Consider adoption of a lower threshold for determining the winner of presidential election. To also address the issue of ethnic politics, further criteria to ensure national spread of votes regionally for the winner of presidential election should be considered. Review the legal framework to strengthen the regulation of party and campaign finance and also strengthen the powers of the PPRC to effectively regulate party finance. In line with article 9(1b) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which Sierra Leone has ratified, the legal framework should be revised to provide affirmative action to promote the representation of women in elective positions. The legal framework should also be revised to provide affirmative action to promote the representation of PWDs in elective positions Election procedures The NEC should consider simplifying the ballot reconciliation and counting procedures to make it less tedious and easier for polling personnel, observers and monitors. The NCRA should finalise the civil registration process that started in 2017 and put appropriate steps in place to effectively register births and deaths. This will further strengthen the credibility of the voter register for future elections. Reconsider the ban on vehicles movement as this creates unnecessary tension and suspicion. CSOs and the media should consider a more inclusive criteria for participation in the presidential debates. All parties should be given equal opportunity to sell their agenda to the electorate. The EISA EOM commends the people of Sierra Leone for turning out in large numbers to register their will on 7 March 2018. In the absence of an incumbent in the presidential race, the presidential election seems to be one of the most keenly contested in the post-civil war period. The EISA EOM notes the efforts of the different institutions to guarantee the integrity of the elections. On election day, voter turnout was impressive and the conduct of polling personnel was professional. There were technical glitches that necessitated the postponement of elections in 18 polling stations. Election day proceeded in a largely peaceful manner albeit with isolated incidents that were immediately addressed. The EISA EOM is of the view that the process up until the end of the first day of tallying has so far been conducted substantially in line with sub-regional, continental and international standards although there is room for improvement especially in the legal framework to further level the playing field. The EISA EOM urges the people of Sierra to remain calm while they wait to see the process through. We call on political leaders to show true leadership by respecting the rule of law throughout the results tally process.

DR-T5-r2,NO,215b24bd01c485e32d92e92b7a3d8f3e,(The Sept. 22 story was refiled to correct the age of Cardinal Zen to 86 from 76 in paragraph 10) By Philip Pullella VILNIUS (Reuters) - The Vatican on Saturday signed a landmark agreement giving it a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, though critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government. The provisional agreement, signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was announced as Pope Francis visited Lithuania on a four-day trip to the Baltic countries. It gives the Holy See a decisive role in the appointment of all bishops in a country whose around 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. The Vatican said the accord, a breakthrough after years of negotiations, was “not political but pastoral”. A Holy See statement did not mention Taiwan, which the Vatican recognizes diplomatically and which China sees as a renegade province. However, diplomats have said the accord was a possible precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations with Beijing after 70 years. Beijing does not allow countries to have diplomatic relations with both China and Taiwan.

The Vatican said the pope hoped “a new process may begin that will allow the wounds of the past to be overcome, leading to the full communion of all Chinese Catholics”. But prospects of such an agreement had divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism. “They’re giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It’s an incredible betrayal,” said Cardinal Joseph Zen, the feisty, 86-year-old former archbishop of Hong Kong who has led the opposition to the deal. “The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the Church in China but for the whole Church because it damages the credibility. Maybe that’s why they might keep the agreement secret,” Zen told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Vatican sources have said the deal will not be published and can be reviewed and fine-tuned in the future. READMITTED The Vatican said that as part of the deal, Pope Francis had recognized the legitimacy of the seven remaining state-appointed Chinese bishops who had been named without papal approval and had re-admitted them into the Church.

REUTERS/ Stefano Rellandini “Today, for the first time all the bishops in China are in communion with the Bishop of Rome (the pope),” Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State and one of the chief architects of the deal, said in a statement. Vatican sources have said that a few bishops appointed by Rome will cede their places to bishops who had been appointed by Beijing. In future, new bishops first will be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities. The names of candidates will be sent to the Vatican and the pope will make a final decision, the sources said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r2,NO,163afdbc4f34c9401641cfe684f5e32e,At 8:45 in the morning on Friday, Feb. 5,2016, Zubair Bin Huda, a director at Bangladesh’s central bank, entered the 30-story, concrete-and-glass headquarters in Dhaka. Bin Huda, slim and soft-spoken, with a thin black mustache and beard, rode an elevator to the ninth floor and eventually walked into the back office of the Accounts and Budgeting Department’s “dealing room,” the most restricted area of the building, accessible to only a handful of employees. Until about a decade ago, Bangladesh’s central bank was stuck in the analog age: Staff members sent international payment instructions via a teleprinter, an electromechanical typewriter that sent and received messages over standard phone lines and other channels. But since a new bank governor took over in 2009, the institution had gone digital. Its international transfer orders are now dispatched via Swift, the Brussels-based electronic network used by 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories. Inside a 12-foot-by-8-foot glass-walled chamber, under the scrutiny of closed-circuit security cameras, staff members log into Swift and dispatch the payment orders with encrypted communications. With a few keystrokes, a complex process is set in motion that sends millions of dollars zipping across continents. Bin Huda was the duty manager that morning, which meant he was tasked with scrutinizing printouts of transfer confirmations, routine queries and other Swift messages that had come in overnight. Friday is a bank holiday in Bangladesh, but a dedicated printer still generated hard copies of digital transfer messages. A few dozen would usually come in over the course of a day, but that morning Bin Huda didn’t see any on the printer. He assumed it was a technical glitch and decided to deal with it on Saturday. At 9 o’clock the next morning, he returned to the office. This time, he found that the Swift software — the program that launches the messaging service — wasn’t functioning, either. Each time he tried to open it, a disconcerting error message appeared: A file is missing or changed. He and his colleagues huddled over the dedicated Swift computer, following directions on the monitor on how to get the software running again. Shortly after noon, he was able to retrieve three messages from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and to print them out one by one. The New York Fed is, in effect, the gatekeeper of much of world banking, and hosts accounts for 250 central banks and governments with deposits of about $3 trillion. A Fed employee had written to Bangladesh, asking for clarification about 46 payment instructions received over the past 24 hours. The Fed had never seen orders like that or a total so large from the bank — nearly $1 billion. It had to be a mistake, Bin Huda thought. Bangladesh Bank, as the central bank is known, never sent payment instructions on weekends, and even during business hours, it rarely sent more than two or three to the Fed in a day. He scrolled through the message file in search of more information. Where was the money headed? The one debit statement he could find was corrupted and unreadable. Desperate to stop the transactions from moving forward, but unsure where to turn, Bin Huda emailed a Swift case manager at the organization’s Brussels headquarters. He told bank officials that he had reported a “big accident” in the Swift system. He tried to reach the Fed in New York by telephone, but the bank was shut down for the weekend. Bin Huda emailed and faxed a demand to the Fed to stop processing all payments, including all those mentioned in the queries. Hoping that someone would get the message, Bin Huda then shut down his computer and went home to enjoy his weekend with his family. Although no one knew this yet, Bin Huda was in the middle of the most daring bank robbery ever attempted using Swift. And it would prove to be the most severe breach yet of a system designed to be unbreachable. Swift’s transmission process — by which money moves through the dispatching of encrypted messages to multiple operating centers and then on to the receivers — has become the standard in the banking world, flawlessly processing more than three billion payment orders a year. It uses “military grade” security systems, says Adrian Nish, the head of Threat Intelligence for BAE Systems, a cybersecurity firm in Britain that investigated the attack on Bangladesh Bank. Swift (the acronym stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a cooperative founded in 1973 and owned by its member banks) recommends that its institutions use multifactor authentication to log on and that they segregate the Swift server from the rest of their internal network. Even for skilled and dedicated hackers, the most viable path to penetrating Swift runs through the member banks, which operate the software that lets them log into the Swift system — providing “the technical handshake that opens the secure pipe,” as one cybersecurity expert put it to me. During the past three years, a rash of smaller incidents have shown the vulnerabilities in the system, as cyberthieves broke into the computer networks of banks in Ecuador, Taiwan, Vietnam, Poland, India and Russia to send out phony payment instructions via the Swift network. Alert bank officials were able to call back some fake payments, but millions of dollars were lost. “A lot of institutions in emerging markets don’t have the same security controls that more mature banks have,” says Patrick Neighorn of FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm. “In some the passwords aren’t centrally managed, or they didn’t know what all the devices connecting their network are.” The Bangladesh job, though, was an order of magnitude more sophisticated. The hackers’ approach was masterly in its foresight and complexity, and the malware they used, or variations of it, later turned up in several of the other bank breaches. The intruders most likely entered the bank’s computer network through a single vulnerable terminal, using a contaminated website or email attachment, and planted malware that gave them total control, even a view of the screens they were manipulating. There, hiding in plain sight, they waited for months to gain an understanding of the bank’s business operations. They harvested employee passwords and worked their way to the most tightly guarded corner of the network: the Swift server. Despite Swift’s warnings, the bank had not segregated its Swift server from the rest of the computer network. “It takes a huge amount of skill to understand the target systems and to be able to subvert them the way they did,” says Nish of BAE Systems. In contrast to off-the-shelf tools that have been used in many recent attacks — such as the “SQL injection code” deployed in 2015 to break into the database of TalkTalk, a British telecommunications firm, and access the bank information and personal details of more than 20,000 subscribers — the malware that the thieves devised was “a custom code, built for attacks on banks and configured for a specific bank,” Nish says. And because it was written from scratch, it was unfamiliar to existing virus-protection programs. After the hackers sent their counterfeit payment orders via the secure Swift messaging network, they completely erased their footprints by deleting those orders from the bank’s Swift database, wiping out the evidence from the printer statements and updating the balances in the bank’s New York Fed account to make it appear that no money had been debited. In effect, Nish says, “the thieves figured out how to make themselves disappear.” A Fed employee had written to Bangladesh, asking for clarification about 46 payment instructions received over the past 24 hours. The Fed had never seen orders like that or a total so large from the bank — nearly $1 billion. Illustration by Francesco Francavilla The hackers also succeeded in turning one of Swift’s defining features — its global reach — into a vulnerability. After months of lurking in the system, they planned their attack for a moment when the banks were unable to communicate effectively. Beginning on Thursday afternoon, New York time, when the Fed had received a total of 70 fraudulent payment orders to four bank accounts in the Philippines and one in Sri Lanka, totaling $1 billion, Bangladesh Bank was closed for the weekend. On Sunday, when the bank reopened and discovered the error, it was unable to reach the Fed. Bin Huda sent a stop-payment order to the Philippines central bank, which was closed for the Chinese New Year. “There was no hotline between the Bangladesh Bank and the Fed in New York,” says Atiur Rahman, the governor of Bangladesh Bank at the time of the heist. “Essentially, I think this was a flaw of the global payment system.” Late on Monday afternoon, Dhaka time, as the Fed was opening for business, Bangladesh Bank asked officials in New York to block the money transfer to the Philippines but were told it was too late and that the money was with recipient banks. On Tuesday morning, more than four days after the theft, Rahman finally reached his Philippine counterpart via a landline from his office and begged him to intervene. The Philippine bank governor asked him to file a written complaint, a Bangladesh Bank official says, and to send it through the diplomatic pouch. Rahman says he was told to keep the matter quiet until it was fully clear what happened. In early March, according to a bank official, an elite police unit was given permission to inspect the back office. Investigators seized passports to see if anyone had traveled to the Philippines, slapped one employee with a travel ban and questioned the others for hours. Rahman resigned a few days later. Ultimately, it was only a few strokes of good luck that kept the heist from being far worse. On Thursday, Feb. 4 — the day before Bin Huda noticed that the Swift software had crashed — five payment orders went through without triggering an alarm: a $20 million deposit for the Shalika Foundation, an agricultural NGO in Sri Lanka that had an account at Pan Asia Bank, and four for individual accounts at the Jupiter branch of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation near Manila. They didn’t clear instantaneously: Fedwire, a Fed-run service for 5,300 clients, enables participants to transfer cash to one another in seconds, but neither of those banks was a member of Fedwire. So the Fed instead began steering the payments to several “correspondent banks” — typically, large commercial institutions that serve as intermediaries between the Fed and smaller banks that aren’t part of its network. In this case, Deutsche Bank had a financial relationship with the bank in Sri Lanka; and the Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank and Wells Fargo dealt regularly with R.C.B.C. When these banks’ automated systems also failed to pick up anything suspicious, the orders were processed. But the next 30 payment orders, totaling $850 million, were held up by a fortunate coincidence. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, says that the automated system flagged the word “Jupiter,” the name of the R.C.B.C. bank branch to which the Swift order was addressed, because it happened to match the name of a totally different business on a sanctions list: Jupiter Seaways Shipping, an Athens-based firm that was blackballed for evading sanctions against Iran. When Fed compliance officers took a close look at the orders, other irregularities became apparent. According to the former Philippine senator Sergio Osmeña III, who later examined the transactions as part of his nation’s investigation into the heist, the payments bore the addresses of the same four account holders in the R.C.B.C. Jupiter branch. “If it hadn’t been for the quick action of someone at the central bank in New York, an additional $900 million would have been lost,” Maloney says. Then one of the first five transactions — those that had initially cleared — ran aground, too. An alert clerk at the small bank in Sri Lanka noticed something that the global players had not: The payment was unusually large for such a small NGO. The clerk held the $20 million order and went to Deutsche Bank for clarification. Deutsche Bank took a closer look and discovered that the word “Foundation” had been misspelled. Suspicious, Deutsche Bank contacted Bangladesh Bank, which sent a stop-payment order. This left four payments, totaling $81 million, that went through — an enormous bank job by any metric (by contrast, the most recent large-scale cyberheist, when hackers hit India’s City Union Bank in February 2018, reaped about $1.5 million) and an enormous blow to the global financial system. “What struck me the most was that this action struck at trust in the international banking system,” Representative Maloney says. “And if you can’t trust international banking, then international commerce could grind to a halt.” Yet when it came to the Bangladesh heist, transferring the cash was only the first part of the scheme. It was one thing to use malicious software to tunnel into the bank’s Swift network and send out dozens of phony transfer orders to banks around the world. It was quite another to turn that digital cash into real money and then make it disappear. Philippine authorities have focused on Maia Santos-Deguito, a career banker in her early 40s, as the linchpin of the heist’s second phase. At the time of the transfers, she was working as the manager of the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation’s Jupiter branch. Santos-Deguito worked at several smaller banks before earning her prized position at R.C.B.C., a branch that primarily serves the residents of Bel-Air Village, an affluent neighborhood of tree-shaded residential streets and busy commercial boulevards lined with yoga salons, boutiques and expensive cafes. In May 2015, nine months before Bin Huda of Bangladesh Bank was baffled by the Swift breakdown, Santos-Deguito met with a longtime client, Kam Sin (Kim) Wong, according to her lawyer. A Hong Kong-born restaurateur and president of Eastern Hawaii Leisure Company, Wong ran “casino junkets” in Manila and northern Luzon, bringing in Chinese high rollers on charter flights, operating V.I.P. rooms in casinos, providing them chips on credit and then taking a cut of the house profit. Wong had experience moving money in and out of an industry where it was nearly impossible to keep track of it. The U.S. State Department’s 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report described the Philippines as a “major” money-laundering site, noting that “criminal groups use the Philippine banking system, commercial enterprises and particularly casinos to transfer drug and other illicit proceeds from the Philippines to offshore accounts.” Beginning on Thursday afternoon, New York time, the Fed had received a total of 70 fraudulent payment orders to four bank accounts in the Philippines and one in Sri Lanka, totaling $1 billion. Illustration by Francesco Francavilla In 2001, the Philippines passed an Anti-Money Laundering Act, and by 2016 the Legislature had amended it three times to evade a blacklist designation by the Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog. But Juan Ponce Enrile, a powerful ex-secretary of national defense, used his position as Senate president to persuade his colleagues to shield casinos from the law — keeping their operations secret and their customers anonymous. In the mid-1990s, Enrile started the Cagayan Economic Zone, a free port near northern Luzon that has attracted casinos and reportedly become a money-laundering hub. The secrecy seems to have been very good for business. In 2016 Bloomberry Resorts, one of the region’s biggest casino operators, posted a net income of $46 million. Melco Crown Philippines Resorts, the operator of City of Dreams Manila, another major gambling resort, had the best-performing casino stock in the world in 2017. “There are no controls, none whatsoever,” Osmeña told me. According to Santos-Deguito’s attorney, Wong introduced her to a few Filipino associates and asked her to open accounts for them at the Jupiter branch. R.C.B.C. colleagues claimed at a Senate hearing that these “clients” never existed, and they accused Santos-Deguito of using forged signatures and a driver’s-license photo from a former colleague to manufacture their identities. Santos-Deguito’s attorney maintains that his client is innocent and says that she trusted Wong. The prospect of lining up wealthy new clients was enticing for her. It was a potential win for her employer, R.C.B.C., as well. Santos-Deguito kept the accounts open — and nearly empty — for eight months. Then on Friday morning, Feb. 5,2016, they suddenly became active. That morning, R.C.B.C. headquarters received Swift instructions from its correspondent banks in the United States to transfer the $81 million into the accounts. Santos-Deguito had already vouched for the integrity of her clients, and she again confirmed that they were legitimate. A colleague at the Jupiter branch testified at the Senate hearings that, on the same day the cash arrived, he watched Santos-Deguito stuff $400,000 into a paper bag and carry it to her car. A three-day weekend, including the Chinese New Year, followed. Then on the morning of Tuesday, Feb. 9, Santos-Deguito arrived at her storefront branch office in Bel-Air Village and began moving the $81 million out of the accounts. By that point, at the R.C.B.C. headquarters in downtown Manila, employees in the payments department were working through a backlog of nearly 800 Swift messages that had accumulated during the holiday weekend. Among them was a stop-payment order marked “urgent” from Bangladesh Bank. The message went unread until 11 a.m. — by which time Santos-Deguito was in the midst of transferring the $81 million into a fifth account, and from there to a remittance firm called PhilRem, owned by a married couple, Michael and Salud Bautista. Santos-Deguito, who claims she was just following her clients’ orders, finished transferring the funds by 11:30 a.m. The Bautistas converted at least $61 million into Philippine pesos — more than three billion of them. Around 7:30 that evening, a courier from PhilRem testified, he picked up a suitcase, a traveling bag and a shoulder bag at the company’s office. The luggage was stuffed with 90 million pesos, worth $1.8 million, and $500,000 in U.S. cash. The courier placed the cash into the back of a van, and with a company driver, his uncle, at the wheel, set out for the Bloomberry-owned Solaire Resort and Casino. There, at the lobby entrance, the pair dragged out the luggage and placed it onto a casino trolley. The courier wheeled the money across the lobby, past rows of digital slot machines and a section of tables for Sabong, a card game based on Philippine-style cock fighting. He took an elevator at the far end of the lobby to the second floor V.I.P. room, where, he testified, Kim Wong, Salud Bautista and one of Wong’s associates were waiting. The Bautistas claimed in Senate testimony that this delivery was the first of many that his firm would make: It delivered $30 million in cash to Wong’s associate and wired $29 million to the Solaire Casino and another $21 million to Wong’s company, Eastern Hawaii. (Through their lawyers, Wong and the Bautistas declined to comment; they have maintained their innocence.) In his Senate testimony, Wong claimed that he received only $13.5 million and that the Bautistas pocketed the rest. Two of Wong’s fellow gambling promoters, Gao Shuhua and Ding Zhize, also received large amounts of cash. In the V.I.P. room at Solaire, a plush lounge with butterscotch carpets, brass chandeliers and about a dozen round baccarat tables, junket players crowded around in a haze of cigarette smoke, drinking Chinese tea and fruit juice while placing their bets. The minimum bet at the table was 10,000 Philippine pesos, or roughly $200 in U.S. cash, and millions of pesos could move into the house or into the player’s pockets in a single evening. At the end of each night, during a spree that seems to have lasted a week or more, the gamblers turned their chips back into untraceable cash. Their names remained unregistered, their winnings unreported: It was, Philippine officials say, the ultimate money-laundering operation. “All we know is that the cash was delivered to certain gamblers at the casinos,” Osmeña says, “and then, after that, the gamblers weren’t here anymore, and the money was gone.” Who had the expertise and the audacity to carry out such a heist? Weeks after the crime, Bangladesh Bank hired FireEye, the U.S. cybersecurity firm, to investigate. FireEye signed a nondisclosure agreement with the bank and has declined to discuss specifics, but some of the bank’s findings have leaked out, and other cybersecurity firms have drawn their own conclusions from publicly available evidence. The analysts compared some of the tools used with those employed in two other notorious cyberattacks: the November 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, when a group calling itself the Guardians of Peace released embarrassing emails and salaries and wiped out many of Sony’s servers; and “Dark Seoul,” a March 2013 hack that disabled internet servers at three South Korean banks and froze computers at two South Korean broadcasters. (The base code, Nish says, was also the same one used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, in which hackers paralyzed more than 200,000 computers around the world and demanded Bitcoin payments to unfreeze them.) All these operations, the experts concluded, bore the markings of what the security firms called the Lazarus Group — a shadowy organization that U.S. intelligence experts say is most likely affiliated with North Korea. Harsh economic sanctions have left the dictatorship struggling with nationwide food shortages and inching ever closer to a nuclear confrontation. At an Aspen Institute panel last March, the National Security Agency deputy director Richard Ledgett mentioned the findings of the cybersecurity firms and said that they could indicate a new level of North Korean criminality. “If that linkage is true, that means a nation-state is robbing banks,” he said. “That’s a big deal; it’s different.” The New York Times has reported that North Korea is believed to maintain a network of about 1,700 computer hackers around the world, aided by 5,000 trainers, supervisors and other support staff. Many operations are aimed at harvesting intelligence from South Korea; others, as in the case of Sony, are intended to avenge slights, or others to reap financial gain. North Korean hackers have become especially adept at targeting the weak links in the financial system: banks in developing nations, especially those in Southeast Asia. “They are easy prey,” says Vitaly Kamluk of Kaspersky Lab, which found Korean-language coding embedded in some Lazarus Group malware and claims it definitively linked the Lazarus Group to North Korea, through an I.P. address that the group briefly used during a wave of attacks in Europe and Central America in 2017. “These central banks often cannot afford good security, good software, or hire a proper specialist to configure their network,” Kamluk says. “They are low-hanging fruit.” ‘All we know is that the cash was delivered to certain gamblers at the casinos, and then, after that, the gamblers weren’t here anymore, and the money was gone.’ Illustration by Francesco Francavilla Although gambling is strictly prohibited inside the country, North Korean leadership has a well-documented interest in the casino industry. The country has been suspected of running online casinos and, according to news reports, has been seeking $20 million from foreign investors to launch a luxury liner and casino that would cruise to Vladivostok and ports in Southeast Asia. Since the heist, Philippine authorities have managed to recover about one-fifth of the missing money for Bangladesh Bank. Wong turned over $15 million, and the Bautistas, suspected by the Senate of walking away with $17 million but still denying wrongdoing, offered to pay $200,0, but the Bangladeshis rejected the money. The rest is probably gone for good. Gone, too, are the shadowy casino-junket operators from mainland China, Ding and Gao, who in February apparently boarded charter flights from Manila to Macau. A former Portuguese colony, Macau has long been an important financial conduit between North Korea and the outside world. Bangladesh Bank is still trying to recoup as much as it can. In February, its deputy governor announced that the bank was filing a lawsuit against R.C.B.C., charging that its employees had doubts about the Swift payment instructions but executed the orders anyway. R.C.B.C., which has been fined a record $1 billion pesos by the Philippine central bank over the incident, threatened a countersuit against Bangladesh Bank for defamation. One bank that did authorize the payments, Wells Fargo, just reached an out-of-court settlement with Ecuador’s Banco del Austro, which had filed a lawsuit seeking to hold the bank responsible for approving the transfer of $12 million from its account in a 2015 cyberheist. The undisclosed settlement could give a boost to Bangladesh Bank’s attempts to recover its losses. In the United States, thanks to Representative Maloney’s prodding, the Fed has instituted a 24/7 hotline to deal with such emergencies. And in the Philippines, the Senate hearings about the crime prompted Congress to impose the first set of transparency rules on the casinos, requiring that every bet over five million pesos, or $100,0, be reported to the Anti-Money Laundering Council. But there was no indication, Osmeña told me, “that anything had changed.” Indeed, Gabriel Lingan, the head of marketing and business development at the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, which oversees the Eastern Hawaii Casino and Resort in Santa Ana, said that nearly a year after the law was passed, the exact policies regarding when and how casinos will file reports were still being negotiated. “We are still working on the details,” he said. Of the many people believed to be involved in the Bangladesh Bank heist, only one faces charges: Maia Santos-Deguito, who was indicted on multiple counts of money laundering and faces a possible 14-year prison term. Kim Wong, the Bautistas and others suspected of helping Santos-Deguito have all walked away. “Santos-Deguito was guilty, and PhilRem was guilty, and to a certain extent Kim Wong was guilty,” Osmeña said one day at his home as servants prepared lunch in his palm-filled garden. “The Department of Justice is very crooked, very crooked, and you would do us a favor if you would point that out,” he went on. “It’s a joke, I’m frustrated by it all, but what can I do?” Officials assume that once the junketeers stepped off the plane in Macau, it would have been easy for them to send the money, via wire or courier, to Pyongyang. But the junket operators’ precise ties to North Korea — or the exact route taken by the cash from Macau — remain a mystery. “We never got to find out who was really behind it,” Osmeña told me, shaking his head in frustration. “And what the ultimate destination is, we don’t know.”

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo (Reuters) - The Vatican, in a highly unusual move, summoned both the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors to express the Holy See’s concern about Israel’s moves to extend its sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank. A Vatican statement on Wednesday said meetings with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and U.S. Ambassador Callista Gingrich and Israeli Ambassador Oren David, took place on Tuesday. A senior diplomatic source told Reuters that Parolin met the two envoys separately, a detail which was not clear in the Vatican statement. It said Parolin, the Vatican’s top diplomat, expressed “the concern of the Holy See regarding possible unilateral actions that may further jeopardize the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the delicate situation in the Middle East”. Israeli leaders decided in May that cabinet and parliamentary deliberations on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, in coordination with Washington, could begin as of July 1. But with no agreement with Washington yet on the modalities of the move under a peace proposal announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January, and talks with the White House still underway, no cabinet session was scheduled for Wednesday. The Vatican statement reiterated its position in support of a two state solution, saying “Israel and the State of Palestine have the right to exist and to live in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders.” The Vatican appealed to Israelis and Palestinians to do everything possible to reopen the process of direct negotiations on the basis of U.N. resolutions. Palestinians seek the West Bank for a future state. In a show of Palestinian unity, some 3,000 people in the Gaza Strip, including members of the mainstream Fatah party and the rival Hamas group that runs the enclave, protested against annexation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r2,YES,e72b4a9488479827b620b266a3f835ec,The Sistine Chapel is to cap the number of visitors allowed into the Roman Catholic church’s greatest artistic treasure, and limit the time they stay by using digital technology. Speaking before the introduction of new lighting and air-conditioning systems for the chapel, where popes have been elected since the mid-15th century, the director of the Vatican Museums, Antonio Paolucci, said: “If the [number of] visitors goes up, we shall introduce a limit of 20,000 visits a day [and] 2,000 at the most at any one time.” About 6 million tourists a year visit the chapel to marvel at Michelangelo’s ceiling and his depiction of the Last Judgment on the altar wall. But, in an interview with the Italian daily La Repubblica, Paolucci said: “From now on, the Vatican Museums will be asking for zero growth.” Although visitors will get less time to view the chapel, Paolucci said: “Starting in the early months of 2015, visitors to the Vatican Museums are going to be offered special, disposable ‘intelligent glasses’ similar to Google Glass that will enable them to explore the Sistine [Chapel] in 3D and go deeper into its history before the actual visit.” Like many of Italy’s most popular cultural attractions, the Vatican Museums are struggling to cope with a surge in visitors, as more people acquire the means to travel. The German firm Osram has installed more than 7,000 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in a gilded, rail-like structure high up on the walls of the chapel to protect the artworks and provide brighter lighting. They will use up to 90% less electricity than the previous system. One the most noticeable effects of the new lights is to heighten the impact of the foreshortening used by the Renaissance masters who frescoed the chapel. Some of Michelangelo’s muscular nudes awaiting the Last Judgment on the altar wall seem almost to have been conjured into three-dimensional life by the new lighting. The side walls of the chapel include masterpieces that have often gone unnoticed by tourists with their heads raised to marvel at Michelangelo’s peerless ceiling. Another effect of the new lights is to draw greater attention to the splendour and vivid colours of the frescoes lining the chapel, which include works by Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino. John Mandyck of the US firm Carrier said the Vatican authorities would have been forced to take even more drastic steps if it had had to continue with the previous air-conditioning facilities. “The pollutants that were being created through those visitors were clearly damaging the frescoes, so they were faced with a decision – to look at a technological solution or look at a solution that limited access to the chapel.” From now on, two cameras mounted on the walls will count the number of people in the chapel and regulate the temperature and humidity accordingly. Carrier’s system will keep the temperature at between 20 and 25 degrees and more effectively filter out the dust brought in by visitors and the carbon dioxide they breathe out. “The actual technology of delivering conditioned air is not new,” said Mandyck. “What’s new here is understanding how air works in this space and also adding the ‘intelligent’ aspect.” Paolucci was hosting a conference on Wednesday on the state of the chapel 20 years after the controversial restoration of its frescoes. The restoration brought out for the first time in centuries the startlingly rich, bright colours Michelangelo used. It shocked many art lovers who had grown accustomed to the muted tones of the grime-coated frescoes. But in an allusion to Irving Stone’s novel about Michelangelo’s labours and his turbulent relationship with Pope Julius II, Paolucci said the great Tuscan master “wasn’t just agony and ecstasy, but pure colour”. Altogether, €3m (£2.4m) has been spent on enhancing the chapel, with Osram and Carrier giving their services free. The lighting project, which also involved an Italian firm and universities in Hungary and Spain, received EU financial support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r2,YES,1f4708d8b233c1fcaf8e43ce78c41502,FATIMA, Portugal (Reuters) - Pope Francis gave the Catholic Church two of its youngest saints on Saturday, canonizing shepherd siblings believed to have seen the Madonna 100 years ago in a Portuguese town that is now a major pilgrimage site. Hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom slept outdoors to hold their places, broke into applause as the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics proclaimed the siblings - Francisco and Jacinta Marto - the newest of the Church’s saints. The two died at the ages of 10 and 9 years old, within three years of the 1917 apparitions, making them the youngest saints of the Church who were not martyrs. The Virgin of Fatima is venerated by Catholics around the world, a following underscored by the many national flags fluttering in the huge crowd, estimated at more than half a million. Marie Chantal,57, a life-long devotee, traveled more than 9,000 km from the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean to attend the ceremony. “I am very emotional because this pope is truly merciful and close to the people and I think he will bring us many good things,” she said. In the homily of a huge outdoor Mass, Francis prayed that the Madonna would protect the most vulnerable members of society, “especially the sick and the disabled, prisoners and the unemployed, the poor and the abandoned”. Two huge tapestries made from century-old photographs of the children dressed in the traditional peasant garb of the times hung from the church that is now the focal point of the sanctuary visited by about seven million people each year.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile Pope Francis prays on the grave of two of the three little sheperd at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Portugal May 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tony Gentile The story of Fatima’s shepherd children has captivated Catholics since their first reported vision on May 13, 1917. The Church believes the Madonna gave three children - Francisco and Jacinta Marto and their older cousin Lucia Dos Santos - three messages, the so-called secrets of Fatima. Dos Santos became a nun and died in 2005 at the age of 97, and efforts are underway to make her a saint as well. The first two secrets were revealed soon and concerned a vision of hell, seen by believers as a prediction of the outbreak of World War Two, a warning that Russia would “spread her errors” in the world, and a need for general conversion to God and prayer. The “third secret” intrigued the world for more than three-quarters of a century, inspiring books and cults convinced that it predicted the end of the world. In 2000, the Vatican said it was a prediction of the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul on May 13, the same day of the first reported apparition in 1917. John Paul believed the Madonna had diverted one of the bullets that hit him from his vital organs. He donated it to the sanctuary, where it is now embedded in the crown of the statue of the Madonna. Gracinda Vieira,57, slept outside during the chill night in Fatima to hold her place near the front of the crowd. “It was not a great sacrifice ... it is very important for me and for the Church,” said Vieira, who had traveled from her home 250 km north of Fatima in central Portugal.

DR-T5-r2,YES,af799f46418dc46dee1d91a6e7b4709e,Mr. Lawsky will continue to investigate foreign banks suspected of Libor manipulation through their New York branches, according to two of the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Lawsky is also investigating the foreign currency manipulation. The Libor investigation, which began seven years ago with a single investigator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has spread to criminal and regulatory agencies around the globe. In addition to the Justice Department’s criminal and antitrust divisions, Deutsche Bank settled with Mr. Lawsky’s office, the trading commission and the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain. As part of the deals, the bank will install an independent monitor, the first such requirement in a Libor case. More broadly, the authorities ordered the bank to dismiss seven managers suspected of involvement in the wrongdoing, all but one of whom are in London. They were among 29 employees suspected of playing a role, most of whom have already left the bank. The settlement is something of a mixed bag for Deutsche Bank. In agreeing to the deals, the bank closes a sordid chapter in its history. But the terms announced on Thursday will be costly to shareholders, and could do further damage to the bank’s already battered reputation. “We deeply regret this matter but are pleased to have resolved it,” Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the co-chief executives of Deutsche Bank, said in a statement on Thursday. “The bank accepts the findings of the regulators.” The size of the fine is particularly hard to swallow for the bank, which had hoped to pay less than $2 billion, one of the people briefed on the matter said. And while the deals will provide some closure to Deutsche Bank, they will not end the bank’s legal problems. It is also ensnared in the foreign exchange investigation. And it is suspected of violating United States sanctions against countries like Iran.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r2,NO,ad2056177467af12321a2f0c505d4e02,MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will visit some of the poorest and most violent corners of Mexico on his first visit as pontiff, and will also head to the northern border to address the plight of migrants trying to reach the United States. Workers put up a poster with an image of Pope Francis along a street at the border with the U.S. in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, February 6, 2016. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez More than 100,000 people have been killed in Mexico’s drug wars over the last decade and its reputation was battered by the case of 43 students abducted and apparently massacred in 2014. President Enrique Pena Nieto´s government botched the investigation, and relatives of the victims are looking to Francis for help in getting to the truth. “The pope ... is coming to see how institutions have sought to forget the case of our children and leave it in impunity. He will see how drug gangs have infiltrated the government,” said Meliton Ortega, whose son Mauricio is among the 43. So far, the remains of just one of the students has been positively identified from charred bone fragments the government says were recovered from a garbage dump in the restive state of Guerrero in southwest Mexico. A team of international experts probing the case has rejected the government’s version of events. Relatives of the students will be among those attending a Mass the pope will say in Ciudad Juarez, on the border with Texas, which was for several years one of the world’s most violent cities. He will also celebrate Mass with indigenous communities in Mexico’s poorest state, Chiapas, speak with young people in Morelia, the capital of violence-torn Michoacan state, and visit prison inmates in Ciudad Juarez. There is no private meeting planned between the students’ relatives and the pope, although such encounters are often organized at the last minute. Ahead of his visit, which begins on Friday, Francis urged Mexicans to battle against corruption and drug gang violence. “The Mexico of violence, the Mexico of corruption, the Mexico of drug trafficking, the Mexico of cartels, is not the Mexico our Mother wants,” the pope said in a video released by the Vatican last week, referring to Our Lady of Guadalupe, who Roman Catholics venerate as the patroness of Mexico. “Of course I don’t want to cover up any of that. On the contrary, I exhort you to fight every day against corruption, against trafficking, against war, against division, against organized crime, against human smuggling.” Pena Nieto’s government has drawn criticism for failing to go after corrupt politicians, even those indicted in the United States. He, his wife and his finance minister have all been embroiled in conflict-of-interest scandals over houses purchased from government contractors. Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said the Pope wants to visit parts of Mexico a pontiff had not visited before, and that the Mass in Ciudad Juarez “is a symbol of his concern for migrants”. Slideshow (2 Images) Illegal immigration is a major issue in the U.S. presidential election campaign with Republican hopeful Donald Trump vowing to put up a wall along the border if he is elected and forcing Mexico to pay for it. “The Mass is being intentionally held right on the border so that it will be visible from both sides,” Lombardi said. “It´s a fence, it´s not a Chinese wall.” The Vatican expects a crowd of at least 200,000 on the Mexican side and of 50,000 on the U.S. side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR-T5-r2, ,87e6eb3a33dd86c05327c7b22dca61b9,Nigeria: I Have More to Offer Than Buhari - Presidential Aspirant By Alex Enumah Abuja — The federal government on Tuesday re-arraigned Nanle Dariye, son of former Plateau State Governor, Senator Joshua Dariye, before the Abuja division of the Federal High Court. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had slammed a six-count amended charge of money laundering to the tune of N1.5bn against the son of the former governor. When the matter was called, the prosecuting counsel, Mr .George Adebola, had informed the trial judge, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, that the matter was for re-arraignment of the defendant. He therefore prayed the court that the charge be read to the defendant for him to take his plea. The defendant however, pleaded not guilty to the charges read against him. Subsequently, Justice Ojukwu adjourned to April 27 for commencement of the trial. The EFCC had first arraigned Nanle Dariye on February 27 on the same charges alongside, 'Apartment le Paradis', a hotel where he was a director. The anti-graft agency alleged that the defendant sometime in 2013 failed to report a cash transaction to the tune of N1.5bn which he received through the hotel's account in one of the old generation banks. According to the commission, the amount was above the threshold of the N10million permissible by law and that the hotel was also not registered as Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI). The agency said the offence contravened Section 5(1) (a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 5 (b) of the same Act. However, following his earlier not guilty plea, he was admitted to bail in the sum of N5m with two sureties in like sum.

DR-T5-r2,NO,0d4fb8eb900956fec6b413b2810bc1f8,French bank Société Générale SA agreed to pay $1.34 billion in penalties to settle allegations by U.S. and New York state authorities that the bank had processed and concealed billions of dollars in transactions related to countries under sanctions. New York regulators said Société Générale conducted transactions involving parties in Iran, Cuba, and Sudan between 2003 and 2013. Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, said the bank engaged in more than 2,500 transactions valued at about $13 billion from 2004 to 2010. The transactions violated U.S. sanctions laws, authorities said. The majority of the transactions and much of the total value involved a dollar credit facility designed to finance oil transactions between a Dutch commodities trading firm and a Cuban company with a state monopoly on the production and refining of Cuban crude, federal prosecutors said. Newsletter Sign-up Risk and Compliance Journal Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. PREVIEW Société Générale avoided detection, in part, by making inaccurate or incomplete notations on payment messages that accompanied the transactions, prosecutors alleged. The department that managed them “engaged in a deliberate practice of concealing the Cuban nexus of U.S. dollar payments,” prosecutors said. The total penalty amount is the second-largest imposed on a financial institution for violations of U.S. sanctions, federal prosecutors said. “Other banks should take heed: Enforcement of U.S. sanctions laws is, and will continue to be, a top priority of this office and our partner agencies,” said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, in a statement. Frédéric Oudéa, Société Générale’s chief executive, said in a statement that the bank regrets the shortcomings identified in the settlements. The bank cooperated with authorities and has taken a number of steps in recent years to enhance its sanctions and anti-money-laundering compliance programs, Mr. Oudéa said. He also referenced the bank’s settlement in June with U.S. and French authorities concerning its alleged manipulation of Libor rates and transactions involving Libyan counterparts. “These resolutions, following on the heels of the resolution of other investigations earlier this year, allow the bank to close a chapter on our most important historical disputes,” Mr. Oudéa said in the statement. The penalty is fully covered by a provision for disputes in its books, the bank said, noting that it won’t have any additional effect on the bank’s results for the year. The bank in September forecast an expected $1.3 billion penalty over the sanctions violations, saying at the time it had entered into a phase of active discussions with U.S. authorities over the matter. Société Générale struck a deferred-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, and agreed to forfeit $717.2 million in a civil forfeiture, prosecutors said. The bank also agreed to pay $325 million to DFS, $162.8 million to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, $81.3 million to the Federal Reserve and $53.9 million to the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions office. It also agreed to continue to cooperate with U.S. authorities in the future. A second consent order with New York’s DFS requires the bank to pay an additional $95 million relating to anti-money-laundering and compliance deficiencies, and it mandates the New York branch to continue a series of enhancements to its compliance program. Under the terms of the consent order, an independent consultant will assess the branch’s progress after 18 months. The Société Générale settlements follows a pattern frequently seen during the Obama administration, in which a bank would reach simultaneous agreements with multiple U.S. state and federal authorities regarding sanctions violations. The pace of these settlements, however, had slowed in recent years. The largest involved BNP Paribas SA, another French bank, which agreed in 2014 to pay nearly $9 billion. Others include HSBC Holdings PLC, which agreed to pay $1.92 billion in 2012, Switzerland’s Credit Suisse AG , which paid $536 million in 2009 and the Netherlands’ ING NV, which agreed to pay $619 million in 2012. —Alberto Delclaux in Barcelona contributed to this article.
