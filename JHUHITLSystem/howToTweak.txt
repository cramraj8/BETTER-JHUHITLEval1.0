Main script : /src/main/java/HITLHuman/HumanMainSearcher.java

What are the other scripts do ?
- /HITLHuman/HumanMainSearcher.java: starts the algorithm, and writes the output retrieval results
- /HITLHuman/HumanRM3Searcher.java : RM3 algorithm wrapped up inside
- /HITLHuman/TermWrapperHuman.java : Each Term (java class) declaration to be used inside HumanRM3Searcher.java

- /src/main/java/BETTERUtils : scripts to read the query files

How RM3 works ?

1. search() : main function that reranks BM25 results with RM3 rescoring

2. mergeTaskReqScoreDocs() : function that merges Task-relevance documents & Request-relevance documents

3. mergeHumanPseudoScoreDocs() : function that merges (Task-relevance documents & Request-relevance documents) with Human-relevance documents

4. expandQuery() : does the query expansion with top-k expanded terms

5. scoreWords() : provide weights to each terms (words)

6. generateScore() : provide (assign) weights to each top-1000 documents

7. reRank() : using the reweighted term scores, assign new weights to the documents, and does reranking

8. normalizeInitialTopSearchScores() : unit-normalize the BM25 scores of top-1000 documents so that the up-weighted relevane document scores can be mixed.


What is happening inside search() function  ?

1. retrieve top-1000 documents

2. merge Task & Request relevane documents list

3. merge pseudo & human relevance document list

4. normalize the top-1000 documents BM25 scores

5. calls rerank() to assign new scores to the top-1000 documents

6. sort the top-1000 documents according to the new weights
