the US\u0027 support of the policy\n(CNN)\nWhen then US President-elect Donald Trump had a 10-minute conversation with Taiwan\u0027s president Tsai Ing-wen in December 2016, he caused a huge diplomatic firestorm.\nThough it\u0027s not uncommon for an incoming leader of one government to speak with the sitting leader of another, Trump\u0027s call with Tsai put the future of US relations with China and Beijng\u0027s ties with Taipei temporarily on ice.\nBut it looks like Trump\u0027s now making moves to smooth over any ruffled feathers.\nIn his first conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping since his inauguration, Trump reaffirmed the US\u0027 commitment to the \"One China\" policy.\nWe take a look at what this is.\nRead More\nWhat is it?\nWashington officially

trust Trump?\nThe policy forms the basis of Chinese diplomacy and policy-making and determines Sino-US relations.\nAlthough the US embassy long ago moved to Beijing from Taipei -- Washington switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC in 1979 -- the island remains an important American ally in the region.\nDespite strong protests from China, the United States continues to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan for its self-defense against a much bigger Chinese military.\nComplicated history\nTaiwan\u0027s official name is the \"Republic of China\" (ROC), tracing its founding to 1911 on the Chinese

Audley Shaw visited the PRC to sign a US $326 million deal with EXIM Bank of China to build Jamaica\u0027s Southern Coastal (four-lane) Highway Improvement Project, which will be completed by China Harbor Engineering Company.\nAdditional agreements have been inked including the Western Children\u0027s Hospital Project and the Office building of the Foreign Ministry.\nDr. Horace Chang, Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, also journeyed to the PRC for a working visit.\nHe met several leaders in the business community including China Harbour Engineering Company, Jiuquan Iron \u0026 Steel Company, EXIM Bank of China and COSCO Shipping lines.\nDr. Chang was invited by the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) to participate in their high-level meeting in Beijing, \"CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties,\" which was held on Nov. 30 - Dec. 3.\nWith Xi in attendance, Dr. Chang gave a presentation to underscore Jamaica\u0027s unwavering support for the Belt and Road Initiative, saying it\u0027s the, \"most ambitious and audacious policy (one that) is precisely the kind of vision … required to truly unite people and trade and bring world markets closer together … We stand prepared as a nation to support this plan to the mutual benefit of Caribbean and Latin-American societies.\nUndeniably, this world is stronger when we work together.\n\"\nThe year 2017 should also be remembered for the first China-LAC Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum that was held in Zhuhai of southeastern Guangdong Province of China.\nThe forum, \"Close Friends Make Distance Disappear,\" was attended by several esteemed members of the Government.\nThis forum was created as a unique platform to promote investment and trade while facilitating more people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China, the Caribbean and Latin America.\nIn today\u0027s rapidly globalizing world, the issue of climate change has become of paramount importance.\nAccordingly, a tree planting ceremony was held to symbolize China\u0027s commitment to sustainable development especially as it relates to its investment projects in the region.\nDuring October\u0027s 19th National Congress of the CPC, Xi announced Beijing would be \"Taking the driving seat into international cooperation in to response to climate change,\" observing that, \"China has become an important participant, contributor, and torch-bearer in the global endeavor for ecological civilization.\"\nPeople-to-People Cultural Exchanges\nA rising number of people-to-people exchanges took place throughout 2017, in the field of sports, for instance, Jamaica has benefited from China\u0027s expertise in synchronized swimming, badminton, gymnastics, volleyball, football and several others.\nJamaican students from the island\u0027s University of Technology were also sponsored by Huawei to engage in its undergraduate training project, \"Seeds for the Future\" in Beijing.\nMs. Cherett Campbell, Minister Counsellor at the Jamaican Embassy (3rd left) is surrounded by students from two of the island’s leading Universities.\nThey were sponsored by Huawei to engage in its undergraduate training scheme \"Seeds for the Future\" program in Beijing.\nJamaica is delighted to offer several scholarships to Chinese nationals at the G C Foster College of Sports and to Caribbean Maritime University in Kingston. Hence, Jamaica\u0027s Minister of Transport and Mining, the Hon. Michael Henry visited Beijing to announce the Government of Jamaica will award ten Chinese students scholarships to study at the Caribbean Maritime University.\nThis educational facility is recognized as one of the best centers for tertiary maritime education in the Western Hemisphere\nCelebrating 45 Years of Diplomatic Ties\nOn November 21, 2017, Jamaica and the People\u0027s Republic of China celebrated their 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Jamaica prides itself as one of the first countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region to establish diplomatic ties with China and the first in the English-speaking Caribbean to adopt the \"One China Policy\".\nThe Government of Jamaica pledged its allegiance to recognition of the One China Policy.\nHis Excellency Antonia Hugh, Jamaica\u0027s Ambassador to the PRC (left) shares lens time with Mr. Ma Peihua, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u0027s Political Consultative Conference, during the unveiling of a commemorative stamp cover done by the Philatelic Association of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PRC.\nThe occasion was the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between both countries.\nIn her remarks, Permanent Secretary in  the Ministry, Ambassador Marcia Gilbert-Roberts, said Jamaica, \"will remain steadfast in our adherence to this important policy, as our friendship is securely anchored in our shared commitment to the principles of sovereignty and respect for the territorial integrity of states … we have enjoyed uninterrupted and dynamic cooperation and political consultation marked by trust, mutual understanding and abiding friendship.\"\nThe Embassy of Jamaica joined together with the Chinese People\u0027s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries to host a luncheon in Beijing.\nAntonia Hugh, Jamaica\u0027s Ambassador to China recounted aspects of our shared history while reminding those attending that Jamaica\u0027s people-to-people connection dates far past these last 45 years, but are over 150 years old.\nThe indelible fact contributes to Jamaica\u0027s enthusiasm towards China\u0027s newest policy—the Belt and Road Initiative.\nAmbassador Hugh said,\n\"We welcome … the Belt and Road Initiative (B\u0026R), which ignores the physical distance between us and focuses on our long history of friendship by building bridges.\nBridges which will take our partnership to new heights in the spirit of the Silk Road by boosting people-to-people and cultural ties, and connecting markets across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.\n\"\nHaving accomplished so much in 2017, even more exciting things await in this dynamic new year ahead.\nBuilding on excellent relations, we look forward to deepening Jamaica-China relations while reaffirming an unswerving commitment of the Government and people of Jamaica to enhance mutual bonds of friendship.\n(The opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Panview or CCTV.com)\nPanview offers a new window of understanding the world as well as China through the views, opinions, and analysis of experts.\nWe also welcome outside submissions, so feel free to send in your own editorials to \" globalopinion@vip.cntv.cn \" for consideration.\n",
