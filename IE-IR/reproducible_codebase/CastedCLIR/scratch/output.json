crisis Read more The decision  estimated at the time to save the city between  1m and  2m annually  sparked a cascade of problems for the cash strapped city  when the state department of environmental quality didn t require the river water to be treated with corrosion control agents  which allowed lead to leach off pipes and flow into households   The widening inquiry comes as Flint s residents continue to cope with the effects of the contamination  Concerns about the water emerged more than two years ago  but residents  complaints were brushed off until last fall  when Gov  Rick Snyder acknowledged the scope of the problem  Tests continue to show that unfiltered tap water is still not safe to drink  and public health workers are trying to monitor thousands of Flint children who may

she withheld information about the severe health risks of using the water after the lead contamination was underway and failed to protect the citizens of Flint  She was charged with one count of misconduct in office  a felony punishable by up to five years in prison  and one count of willful neglect of duty  a misdemeanor  The other Department of Environmental Quality employees charged were Adam Rosenthal  a water regulator who prosecutors said doctored reports about lead levels in Flint s water  and Patrick Cook  another regulator they said misled officials with the federal Environmental Protection Agency about the city s water quality  Both men were charged with misconduct in office and conspiracy  Mr  Cook was also charged with willful neglect of duty  and Mr  Rosenthal with tampering with evidence  Also charged were Nancy Peeler  the Early Childhood Health Section manager in the state s Department of Health and Human Services  Robert Scott  a data analyst for the department  and Corinne Miller  a state epidemiologist  Prosecutors said the three employees learned last July of a spike in the number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels but concealed the results  After seeing an internal report showing the increase  Mr  Schuette said  Ms  Peeler and Mr  Scott  produced a bogus report  that showed no worrisome rise in lead levels   Michael Glasgow  a former Flint city employee charged in connection with the city s water crisis  has reached a deal with prosecutors  Glasgow tampered with a 2015 report   Lead and Copper Report and Consumer Notice of Lead Result   and failed to perform his duties as a treatment plant operator  the Michigan Attorney General s Office said  Under the terms of the deal  the felony charge of tampering with evidence was dismissed  In exchange  Glasgow gave a plea of no contest to willful neglect of duty  a misdemeanor  citing reasons of possible civil liability  according to his attorney
