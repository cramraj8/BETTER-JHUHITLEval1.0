Currently, residential photovoltaics supply the majority of solar power in the US, but recently large scale solar power generation facilities have been deployed in southwestern states.  The boom in solar energy is creating new jobs in manufacturing, installation, and power generation.  Recently, tariffs have brought some uncertainty to the marketplace.",
